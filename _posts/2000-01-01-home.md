## 3rd Master Course on
# ** Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence **
{: .text-purple}
## Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya 

### ETSETB TelecomBCN (Autumn 2019)

Deep learning technologies are at the core of the current revolution in artificial intelligence for multimedia data analysis. The convergence of large-scale annotated datasets and affordable GPU hardware has allowed the training of neural networks for data analysis tasks which were previously addressed with hand-crafted features. Architectures such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks or Q-nets for reinforcement learning have shaped a brand new scenario in signal processing. This course will cover the basic principles of deep learning from both an algorithmic and computational perspectives.
